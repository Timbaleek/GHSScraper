# GHSScraper
Scrapes GHS data from PubChem Website

DISCLAIMERS:

The program needs internet to function, otherwise it will crash.
PubChem is expansive, but not exhaustive. In some rare cases you will have to look up the GHS phrases the old-fashioned way on SigmaAldrich. Beware, the program (should) not crash and instead write that it found not GHS phrases.
You need to cite PubChem for the GHS-Phrases. More on that here: https://pubchemdocs.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/citation-guidelines
